# Probability Mass Function

A probability mass function (PMF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It assigns probabilities to each possible value that the random variable can take on.

For a given discrete random variable X, the probability mass function P(X = x) gives the probability of X taking on the value x. The PMF satisfies the following properties:

1. Non-negativity: The probability assigned by the PMF is non-negative for all possible values of X.

2. Summation: The sum of probabilities over all possible values of X is equal to 1. In mathematical notation, âˆ‘ P(X = x) = 1, where the sum is taken over all possible values of x.

The probability mass function allows us to determine the likelihood of different outcomes of a discrete random variable. By evaluating the PMF at specific values, we can calculate the probability of observing those values.

For example, let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF for this random variable would be:

P(X = 1) = 1/6
P(X = 2) = 1/6
P(X = 3) = 1/6
P(X = 4) = 1/6
P(X = 5) = 1/6
P(X = 6) = 1/6

These probabilities represent the equal chance of obtaining each outcome when rolling a fair six-sided die.

The PMF is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is widely used in various fields, including statistics, discrete mathematics, and computer science. It provides a concise way to represent the probability distribution of discrete random variables and is crucial for analyzing and understanding random phenomena with discrete outcomes.
