# Tensor Calculus

These notes based on [Tensor Calculus][]

The YouTube channel "Tensor Calculus" focuses on educational content related to tensor calculus, a mathematical framework used in various scientific and engineering fields. The channel likely offers tutorials, explanations, and examples to help viewers understand and apply tensor calculus concepts. This could include topics such as vector spaces, tensor algebra, differential forms, and applications in physics and engineering. For more details, you can visit the channel [Tensor Calculus][].

I will try to relate the things that I understand from the video channel to `sympy`.
