# Vectors tensors and fields

I found this set of lectures that provide an excellent introduction to
[vectors tensors and fields][]. The lecture are provided by John Peacock
The document is structured as a set of 11 lectures, each with a set of
notes, examples, and exercises. The notation and terminology used in
the document are standard in the field of vector and tensor calculus.
The document is well-written and clear, with many illustrative examples
and diagrams.

Overall, the document is a valuable resource for anyone interested in
learning vector and tensor calculus, as well as its applications in
physics and mathematics.
