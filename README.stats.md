# Random Variable

* A __random variable__ is a variable whose possible values are
numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon.
* A random variable is discrete if it can take only a countable number
of distinct values and it is continuous if it can take an infinite
number of possible values.
* A probability distribution specifies the probabilities for each of
the values that a random variable may take.
* A probability distribution of a discrete random variable is
called a __probability mass function__ and gives probabilities on
the y-axis.
* A probability distribution of a continuous random variable is
called a __probability density function__ and gives probability
densities on the y-axis, in this case probabilities are given
by the surface area under the curve within a specified interval.
* A probability density function can exist in the form of a table,
a graph and an equation.

# Cumulative Probability

* A __cumulative probability__ of a random variable is the probability
of obtaining a value lower than or equal to a threshold-value.
* Considered in the other direction, a cumulative probability specifies
a quantile of the random variable, for example at the cumulative
probability of oh point five the median of the random variable is found.
* Just like a probability distribution, the cumulative probability
distribution can exist in the form of a table, a graph or an equation.
* It can be obtained by calculating a cumulative sum of the
probabilities from the smallest up to the largest value of the
random variable.
* And it is continuously increasing with an increasing value for the
random variable, starting at zero and incrementing to a probability
of one.

# Sampling

In statistics, there are two main forms of sampling:
__probability sampling__ and __non-probability sampling__.


* **Probability sampling** is a method of sampling where every member of
the population has a known chance of being selected. This is the most
reliable type of sampling, as it minimizes the risk of bias. There are
four main types of probability sampling:
    * **Simple random sampling:** This is the simplest form of
    probability sampling. Every member of the population has an equal
    chance of being selected.

    * **Systematic sampling:** This is a type of probability sampling
    where every kth member of the population is selected. For example,
    if you wanted to select a sample of 100 people from a population of
    1000 people, you would select every 10th person on the list.

    * **Stratified sampling:** This is a type of probability sampling
    where the population is divided into strata, or groups, and then
    a sample is selected from each stratum. This ensures that the
    sample is representative of the population as a whole.

    * **Cluster sampling:** This is a type of probability sampling
    where the population is divided into clusters, or groups, and then
    a sample of clusters is selected. The members of the selected
    clusters are then included in the sample.

* **Non-probability sampling** is a method of sampling where not every
member of the population has a known chance of being selected. This
type of sampling is less reliable than probability sampling, but it
is often used when it is not possible to use probability sampling.
There are several types of non-probability sampling:

    * **Convenience sampling:** This is a type of non-probability
    sampling where the sample is selected based on convenience.
    For example, a researcher might survey the first 100 people they
    see walking down the street.
    * **Voluntary response sampling:** This is a type of
    non-probability sampling where the sample is selected based on
    whether or not people volunteer to participate. For example,
    a researcher might place an ad in the newspaper asking people
    to participate in a survey.

    * **Purposive sampling:** This is a type of non-probability
    sampling where the sample is selected based on the researcher's
    judgment. For example, a researcher might select a sample of
    people who are experts in a particular field.

    * **Quota sampling:** This is a type of non-probability sampling
    where the sample is selected to represent different groups in the
    population. For example, a researcher might select a sample of
    people that is representative of different age groups, genders,
    and income levels.

The best type of sampling method to use depends on the specific
research question being asked. If it is important to have a
representativesample of the population, then probability sampling is the
best option. However, if it is not possible to use probability
sampling, then non-probability sampling may be the only option.
