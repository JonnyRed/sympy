Significance: The significance value, often referred to as the p-value, represents the probability of observing a correlation coefficient as extreme as the one calculated (or even more extreme) under the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two variables. In this case, the p-value is 0.029, which is below the conventional significance level of 0.05. It indicates that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant correlation between the variables.\n",
